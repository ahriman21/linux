* linux file structure :
- /bin : directory of basic binraries or a place to save terminal programs, commands and codes.

- /sbin : admin system binaries . a place for terminal programs or commands that are more related to admin user.

- /boot : this directory contains files that your machine needs to boot like bootloader.

**- /dev : your hardwares are stored in this directory as a file .

- /lib : this directory contains libraries that are required when you use a program.

- /media : mounted SDs go to this directory. for example when you plug in a usb device.

- /mnt : this is quite like media directory but it's for SDs that you mount manually.

**- /opt : or optional directory is used for storing manually installed applications .

- /proc : a directory for all procceces running in linux. and all info about cpu , ram , ...

- /root : a home directory for root users (admin users).

**- /run : temp file systems that runs in ram.
