Checking for updates of your installed applications in Linux and installing them from the terminal involves using the `apt-get` package manager. This command-line tool is commonly used to manage and install software packages on Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Mint, and Pop!_OS.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to check for and install updates using the `apt-get` command in the terminal:

1. **Open the terminal:** Find and open the terminal application. It's typically located in the Applications menu or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.

2. **Check for updates:** Run the following command to check for updates to all installed packages in the system repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

   This command fetches the latest package information from the repositories, preparing it for the update process.

3. **Install updates:** Once the update information is downloaded, run the following command to install the available updates:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

   This command will download and install the latest versions of all installed packages, ensuring your system has the latest security patches and bug fixes.

   Make sure to provide your system password when prompted to elevate privileges for the `sudo` command.

4. **Verify installed updates:** After the update process completes, you can verify which packages have been updated by running the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -l | grep '^ii ' | grep 'new'
   ```

   This command will list all installed packages with the "new" flag, indicating that they have been updated. You can further narrow down the output by specifying the package name you're interested in. For instance, to check for updates to Firefox, you would run:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -l | grep '^ii firefox-' | grep 'new'
   ```

Remember to regularly check for updates and install them to maintain the security and stability of your Linux system.
